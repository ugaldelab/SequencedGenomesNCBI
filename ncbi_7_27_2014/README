Directory Content:
====================================

This directory contains summary reports conveying the organism scope and 
detailed genome project reports grouped by major taxonomic divisions.

The taxonomic division reports include information on genome data submitted 
to the primary archival sequence data that is exchanged among members of the 
International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration (INSDC) and genome 
data represented in NCBI RefSeq dataset. 

These files correspond to the tables available online at: 
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/browse/

Archaea and Bacteria reference and representative genomes
Code definitions:

    CLI = Clinical Isolate
    TYS = Type Strain
    FGS = First Genome sequenced
    PRT = Proteomics
    UPR = UniProt genomes
    QfO = species selected by the "Quest For Orthologs" group
    PHY = representative member at a phylogenetically interesting position 
    MOD = Model organism
    CCA = Community Consortium Annotation
    CALC= Calculated
    COM = Community selected reference
    

Each species in Entrez genome collection that has assembly data, either complete or WGS, 
has at least one reference or representative genome. For some well-studied species of great 
biomedical interest or high diversity more than one reference or representative is selected.

Reference genomes are defined as genomes of high quality sequence and annotation and/or 
the isolates that have been used by the research community for clinical studies, 
experimental validation, comparative analysis.

The source of reference genomes:

    UniProt reference proteome
    The genomes with extensive proteomics support for the annotation.
    Community curated annotation
    Community selected reference

Representative genomes are selected based on the following rules:

    the only genome sequenced
    the only complete genome for species
    multiple complete genomes or no complete genome
        Type strain
        First complete genome sequenced
        Human Microbiome reference
        Highest assembly quality

Calculated:
For large clades (> 5 genomes) a representative is calculated by protein cluster analysis: 
the genome with maximum number proteins in clusters is selected.
