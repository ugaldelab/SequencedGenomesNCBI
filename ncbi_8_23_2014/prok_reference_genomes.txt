(2)	PHY/CLI	This pathogenic strain of E. coli is enterohemorrhagic and a cause of foodborne illness. Most cases of food poisoning have been linked with eating undercooked contaminated ground meat, raw contaminated vegetables or unpasteurized milk. Waterborne transmission occurs by swimming in contaminated lakes or pools, or by drinking contaminated water. The organism is communicable person-to-person and has caused outbreaks in child day-care centers. E. coli O157:H7 requires specific receptors in order to attach to and enter intestinal cells. Cattle, swine, and deer do not have these receptors, and so can harbor the strain in their intestines without ill effect. The strain contaminated meat during slaughter or butchering, and when undercooked meat is eaten causes acute hemorrhagic diarrhea and abdominal cramps. In healthy adults, the symptoms subside in 5-10 days. In children and the elderly, the infection can cause hemolytic uremic syndrome (2-7% of cases), in which the red blood cells are destroyed and the kidneys fail. This strain is the representative of E. coli sub-clade E.	10734605,11108008,11111050,11258796	http://www.genome.wisc.edu/; http://ecocyc.org/
